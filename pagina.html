To receive certification, a building must accrue a set number of environmental "points.” Storm-water management, proximity to mass transportation, and creating renewable energy, for example, net points. A comprehensive application (including photos, construction documentation, floor plans, LEED checklists, etc.) is submitted to LEED, which reviews the request.</td>

        Ten years ago, this would have been unheard of. The last several decades have been unkind to Crown Heights. Race riots, drug dealing, and abandoned buildings were common sights.

Storefronts went vacant, and the neighborhood’s reputation for danger was well founded. Hence, the project’s enthusiastic embrace by the surrounding community.</td>

        Grants are not the only awards Susan and Benton have received either. On April 7 ribbon- cutting at the Icehouse Lofts, Borough President Markowitz unfurled an unusual proclamation: "Today,” he said, "I decree to be Susan Boyle and Benton Brown Day . . . Together, we can paint this town green.”</td>

        Local auto body workers and neighbors have followed the project closely, Boyle says. They constantly inquire about updates, and Boyle and Brown appease curiosity with tours. "The [neighborhood] has been very accepting and supportive,” Boyle says.</td>

        The couple accepted their awards with sheepish smiles of people not accustomed to the spotlight. For two years they’ve toiled countless seven-day weeks. Work has been hard, and it’s not over yet.</td>

        When the couple bought the icehouse, they also received the brewery itself— another daunting brick structure in disrepair. The building, bearing faded ads for Heinz Ketchup, is connected via the backyard — and underground brick tunnels — to the icehouse. The structure sits idle, but it has potential. Boyle and Brown have dreamed up a few ideas, but for now their plan is simple:</td>
