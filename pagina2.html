    <h1>Assignment Reflection </h1>
<p>Putting the paragraphs into a table format was easy for me. Tables in HTML are simple to understand and helped me organize the text into columns like in the newspaper. Once I learned the basic tags, it was not difficult to place the information where it needed to go.</p>
<p>Adding the picture was more challenging. I had to make sure the image file name was written exactly the same and that it was saved in the correct folder. Sometimes the image did not appear, and I had to check for small mistakes, which took some time to understand. </p>
<p>Recreating the lines that separate the paragraphs exactly like in the newspaper was not possible using only HTML. To make them look exactly the same, it would be necessary to use CSS to control the style and spacing. Since we were not allowed to use CSS, I could only create simple lines, but not make them look identical to the newspaper.</p>
